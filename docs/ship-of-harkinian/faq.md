# F.A.Q.

## Where can I get a ROM?
We cannot help you with this. You must own a legal copy of the game and dump the ROM using other software not provided by us. Downloading a ROM from the internet is illegal and we do not condone it, and if you are found to be doing this you will be banned from our Discord server.

## What do the release names mean?
Nothing significant, they are just fun names we give to our releases.

## Is this legal?
We are not distributing any Nintendo owned IP. Users must provide legally obtained ROMs to experience Ship of Harkinian. We also have a strict no piracy policy enforced around our community.

## Why aren't ETAs given?
This is a project done by volunteers during their spare time for free. The work gets accomplished by whoever's interested in implementing what, with a few things being prioritized as milestones for stable releases. To set deadlines would be to create unrealistic expectations that would likely never be met and cause disappointment.

## Why is this called Ship of Harkinian?
I don't know.

## Can I Load existing ROM Hacks?
No. For ROM hacks to be playable on these ports would require the creator of the hack to recreate their changes within the port's codebase, and distribute a custom build. Recomp is likely a better option for this when the eventual OoT recomp is released.
