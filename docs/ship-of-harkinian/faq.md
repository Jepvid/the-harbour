# F.A.Q.

## Can I Load ROM Hacks?

**No.**

The HM64 projects are ports, not emulation; they do not "load" or "run" the source ROMs - all game code is in the executable itself; no part of game operation comes from the ROM.

The ROM is required for asset extraction: All of the 3D models, textures, sound, text, map layouts... everything that makes the game you know and love... those are protected by copyright - distributing them would be illegal, and a guaranteed path to getting this entire thing shut down. Obviously, nobody wants that. Thus, we require users to supply a legally obtained ROM to extract those assets. The extraction step is the only time the ROM is touched.

For ROM hacks to be playable on these ports would require the creator of the hack to recreate their changes within the port's codebase, and distribute a custom build.

## Where Can I Get Mods?

Mods are extremely simple for the end user; your installation folder on most platforms will include a `mods` directory - if it didn't, you can create that folder yourself.

You need only place mod OTR archives in this directory, or subdirectories within, and check the **Use Alternate Assets** option - the TAB key functions as a shortcut to toggle this option.

### Mod Sources

The best place to find mods is on GameBanana:
- **Ship of Harkinian Mods**: https://gamebanana.com/games/16121

Some mods - especially Works in Progress - will not be found on GameBanana, but instead in dedicated threads on the HM64 Discord:
