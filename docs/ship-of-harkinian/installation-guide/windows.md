## Step 1: Downloading Ship of Harkinian

:::caution Important
This is the code that will interact with the Assets required in Step 2. This does NOT provide you with any Nintendo Licensed Assets.
:::

[Click here](https://github.com/HarbourMasters/Shipwright/releases/latest) to go to the releases page on GitHub, where you will find the links for **all latest versions** of Ship of Harkinian. Find and click the link that has **Windows** in the name.

**Extract the Zip file** into a Folder on your **Local Hard Drive** for later.

:::warning
- Do NOT just open the zip and run SoH from there, things will break.
- Do NOT extract this to C:\Windows, C:\Program Files, or a cloud drive location, things will break.

## Step 2: Obtaining a ROM (Legally)

Follow the steps outlined in the [ROM Dumping Guide](https://www.shipofharkinian.com/setup-guide/dump-guide) to **legally** obtain a **usable ROM** for Ship of Harkinian.

The ReadMe file **included with the download** mentioned in Step 1 lists out the **CRC/SHA1 Hash** and a website to verify your version. **Incorrect versions are not supported** and you will see an error or the game will not load.

## Step 3: Extracting the Assets and Launching Ship of Harkinian

Assuming you correctly followed the instructions in Step 1 and Step 2, you are now ready for the last process.

Open the Folder you extracted from Step 1 and launch the **soh.exe** file.

:::tip
You can ignore any AntiVirus or Windows SmartScreen notifications, these are false positives due to these programs having too little information about Ship of Harkinian.
:::

Once **soh.exe** has been opened for the first time you will be greeted with a popup window. Select **Yes** at this prompt.

If your ROM is **not located in the same folder as the SoH.exe** you will have one additional prompt. Select **Yes** at this prompt too.

Locate the ROM that you **dumped in Step 2** and double click it to begin the Asset Extraction process.

This Asset Extraction process will happen silently in the background.

:::info
You can safely ignore any errors displayed during this process, as long as the console window closes and you see the completion prompt.
:::

If you have a Master Quest ROM you wish to create an oot-mq.otr from, select **Yes**. Otherwise, select **No**.

Once you have completed the extraction process the Game will automatically launch.

**Congratulations, you can now play Ocarina of Time on Ship of Harkinian!**
