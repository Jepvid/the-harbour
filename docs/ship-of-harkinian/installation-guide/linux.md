## Step 1: Downloading Ship of Harkinian

:::caution Important
This is the code that will interact with the Assets required in Step 2. This does NOT provide you with any Nintendo Licensed Assets.
:::

[Click here](https://github.com/HarbourMasters/Shipwright/releases/latest) to go to the releases page on GitHub, where you will find the links for **all latest versions** of Ship of Harkinian. Find and click the link that has **Linux** in the name. We recommend trying the performance build first.

**Extract the Zip file** into a Folder on your **Local Hard Drive** for later.

:::warning
Do NOT extract this to a temporary or a cloud drive location, things will break.

## Step 2: Obtaining a ROM (Legally)

Follow the steps outlined in the [ROM Dumping Guide](https://www.shipofharkinian.com/setup-guide/dump-guide) to **legally** obtain a **usable ROM** for Ship of Harkinian.

The ReadMe file **included with the download** mentioned in Step 1 lists out the **CRC/SHA1 Hash** and a website to verify your version. **Incorrect versions are not supported** and you will see an error or the game will not load.

## Step 3: Extracting the Assets and Launching Ship of Harkinian

Assuming you correctly followed the instructions in Step 1 and Step 2, you are now ready for the last process.

Open the Folder you extracted from Step 1 and copy the ROM you created in **Step 2** to this location.

Launch the **soh.appimage** file.

:::tip
You may have to `chmod +x` the appimage via terminal.
:::

Locate the ROM that you **dumped in Step 2** and double click it to begin the Asset Extraction process.

Asset Extraction will begin and the **oot.otr** will be generated. This will happen **silently in the background**. Once it has completed the Game will **automatically launch**.

**Congratulations, you can now play Ocarina of Time on Ship of Harkinian!**
