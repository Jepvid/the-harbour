# Installation Guide

:::info
You will need to provide a compatible ROM of Ocarina of Time, currently we support most versions. You can check if your ROM is compatible [here](https://ship.equipment/).
:::

1. **Download** The latest release at [this location](https://github.com/HarbourMasters/Shipwright/releases/latest).
2. **Extract ZIP** to a location on your local hard drive. Do not run the game from within the zip file, and do not extract to a cloud drive or temporary location.
    - On MacOS, the zip contains a DMG, open this up and drag the app to your Applications folder.
:::warning
When updating, always extract all contents of the zip to your existing folder, overwriting all conflicting files.
:::
3. **Open the executable/app** and follow the prompts to select your ROM.
    - On MacOS, you may have to go into your System Settings > Privacy & Security to approve the app after trying to open it for the first time.
4. Enjoy!
