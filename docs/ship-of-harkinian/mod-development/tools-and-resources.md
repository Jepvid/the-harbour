# Tools and Resources

Essential tools and resources for Ship of Harkinian mod development.

## Core Tools

### Fast64

- Configure materials and display lists

### O2R Workspace (Web Tool)

A web-based tool for working with O2R/OTR archives without needing to set up the full development environment.

**URL:** https://o2r.garrettcox.dev/

**Current Capabilities:**
- Replace Link animations with C files (output from fast64)
- Replace actor animations with C files (output from fast64)
- Upload generic files and attach an O2R header to them
- Preview images (including palette support)
- Preview Hex of all resources

### SoH Audio Tool

A tool for converting WAV files into the format Ship of Harkinian expects for custom audio samples.

**Download:** https://github.com/Jameriquiah/SoH-AudioTool/releases

**Features:**
- Convert WAV files to SoH/2Ship format
- Support for loop points
- Batch conversion support
- Works on Windows, macOS (via drag-and-drop), and Linux
- Drag and drop WAV files directly onto the window

:::warning
This is ONLY for audio samples, not streamed audio. The sample rate must match the sample you're replacing, or else you will get slowed down or sped up audio.
:::

**Ideal Use Cases:**
- Voice packs
- Custom sound effects
- Replacing any audio sample in the game
