## Scene Editing

### Scene Mesh Replacement

**A Rough Tutorial on Scene Editing for Ship of Harkinian**
- Learn how to edit and replace scene meshes
- Covers finding DLs with the GFX debugger
- https://youtu.be/h-2iBjnSkLs

**Key Concepts:**

Scene mesh replacement works mostly like typical DL replacement. The main challenge is finding the individual DLs per scene using the GFX debugger.

**Process:**
1. Use the GFX debugger to locate the specific DisplayList you want to replace
2. Look for the `G_MARKER` at the top of the DL
   - Example: `G_MARKER: scenes/shared/spot01_scene/spot01_room_0DL_009A70`
3. Replace that DL path using your modding tools (like Retro)

:::note
This only affects the scene mesh, not collision or other scene properties.

**Key Points:**
- Export animations using Fast64
- Edit timing and keyframes
- Re-import into your mod

## Advanced Topics

### Finding Display Lists

Use the **GFX Debugger** (built into Ship of Harkinian) to identify the exact path of any DisplayList in the game:

1. Pause at the frame showing the object/mesh you want to replace
2. Open the GFX Debugger
3. Step through commands to find your target
4. Note the `G_MARKER` path
5. Use that path in your replacement mod

### Working with Decomp

Some advanced modding requires working with the game's decompiled source code. While more complex, this allows for:
- Deep code modifications
- Custom features and mechanics
- Understanding game internals

:::tip
The beginner setup tutorial above covers getting the decomp running. Once comfortable with basic modding, exploring the decomp can unlock new possibilities.

## Tips for Learning

1. **Start Simple** - Begin with texture replacements before attempting full models
2. **Follow Along** - Watch tutorials with Blender open and follow each step
3. **Ask Questions** - The Discord community is helpful; don't hesitate to ask
4. **Reference Examples** - Download existing mods and examine their structure
5. **Iterate** - Your first model probably won't be perfect; keep practicing
6. **Save Often** - Both in Blender and when exporting; crashes can happen
7. **Test Frequently** - Load your mod in-game often to catch issues early
