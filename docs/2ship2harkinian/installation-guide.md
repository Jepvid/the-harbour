You will need to provide a compatible ROM of Majora's Mask, currently we only support the US and US GC versions. You can check if your ROM is compatible [here](https://2ship.equipment/).

1. **Download** The latest release at [this location](https://github.com/HarbourMasters/2ship2harkinian/releases/latest).
2. **Extract ZIP** to a location on your local hard drive. Do not run the game from within the zip file, and do not extract to a cloud drive or temporary location.
    - On MacOS, the zip contains a DMG, open this up and drag the app to your Applications folder.
:::warning
When updating, always extract all contents of the zip to your existing folder, overwriting all conflicting files.

3. **Open the executable/app** and follow the prompts to select your ROM.
    - On MacOS, you may have to go into your System Settings > Privacy & Security to approve the app after trying to open it for the first time.
