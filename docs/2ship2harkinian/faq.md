# F.A.Q.

## Where can I get a ROM?
We cannot help you with this. You must own a legal copy of the game and dump the ROM using other software not provided by us. Downloading a ROM from the internet is illegal and we do not condone it, and if you are found to be doing this you will be banned from our Discord server.

## What is the difference between 2 Ship 2 Harkinian and Zelda 64: Recompiled?
Different processes to achieve a similar result, a running version of the game on your computer. There are upsides and downsides to both, and we encourage you to try both and see which one you prefer. 2 Ship 2 Harkinian provides a lot of options and customization out of the box but the gameplay behavior cannot easily be extended by 3rd party mods, whereas Zelda 64: Recompiled relies much more heavily on mod support and the modding community to provide features, and because of how their modding framework works, the sky is the limit for what can be done.

## What do the release names mean?
Nothing significant, they are just fun names we give to our releases.

## Is this legal?
We are not distributing any Nintendo owned IP. Users must provide legally obtained ROMs to experience Ship of Harkinian. We also have a strict no piracy policy enforced around our community.

## Why aren't ETAs given?
This is a project done by volunteers during their spare time for free. The work gets accomplished by whoever's interested in implementing what, with a few things being prioritized as milestones for stable releases. To set deadlines would be to create unrealistic expectations that would likely never be met and cause disappointment.

## Why is this called 2 Ship 2 Harkinian?
I don't know.
